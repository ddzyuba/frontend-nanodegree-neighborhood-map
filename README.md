# Frontend Nanodegree Neighborhood Map

> by Dmitriy Dzyuba

## Description

This is the fifth project for the Udacity Front-end Web Developer Nanodegree program. The Neighborhood Map project involves developing a single page application with the KnockoutJS framework and various API's. Aside from the Google Maps API, additional information is added to the project locations with the FourSquare API loaded asynchronously. KnockoutJS allows the project to be organized with the MVVM pattern.
